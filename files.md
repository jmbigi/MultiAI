# Files

- `data` - This directory is typically used for storing datasets used by the project. 
  - `input` - Might contain the input data for the project, like training datasets or input for testing.
  - `output` - This could be where the output data or results of any executed scripts are stored.

- `main.py` - This is often the main entry point of the project. It is the script you run to start the program.

- `main_training_samples_1.py` - This script might be a variant or specific version of the main training script, possibly focusing on a specific set of samples.

- `model` - This directory likely contains files related to the machine learning model, such as scripts for model definition, training, evaluation, or usage.
  - `generate_code.py` - This script might be for generating code or textual output based on the trained model.
  - `reverse_engineer.py` - This could be a script that attempts to understand or modify the model, or its outputs.

- `prediction` - This directory likely contains scripts and resources related to making predictions with a trained model.
  - `code_prediction_1.py` - A script to perform prediction or inference using the trained model.
  - `python_code_001.txt` - This file might contain Python code that is being used as a sample for testing the prediction capabilities of the model.

- `Readme.md` - This Markdown file usually contains comprehensive information about the project, like its purpose, how to set up and run it, its dependencies, and more.

- `tests` - This directory would typically contain test scripts or test cases used to verify the functionality and correctness of the project code.

- `training` - This directory likely contains scripts and resources related to model training.
  - `train_model.py` - The script that trains the model using provided data.
  - `checkpoint` - A directory where the state of the model is saved periodically during training. This allows training to be resumed later from these checkpoints if it gets interrupted.

- `utils` - A directory for utility scripts and helper functions which are used across the project.
